### LaboratoryResultAutomation

**Laboratory Results Automation Project by Java.**

***Project Description:*** An abstract laboratory database was created and the operations performed in any laboratory were simulated.
(Analysis result entry by the authorized person, analysis deletion, patient record deletion, patient record addition, tracking and listing the personal information of all patients in the system, seeing the results by entering the necessary information, etc.)

***SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:***
1) JAuthorized: In this frame, the authority enters the user name and password and is directed to the transaction tab.

2) JAuthorizedOperations: In this frame, the authorized person performs the operations that he/she has access to.

3) BloodAnalysis, UrineAnalysis, PathologyAnalysis classes: Since each assay will hold a different value, there are getters and setters that allow us to pull the name and amount of data to be kept for each assay from the database.

4) JPatient: In this frame, the analyzes of our patients are taken from the database. and the patient can see the result by entering the required information.

5) JResultFrame: Users can view the assay results.

6) JProgramInterface: One of the User and Authorized entries is selected. And redirects to that page
